		<h2>Study Abroad: Summer 2019</h2>
		<p>In the summer of 2019, I decided to do a 4 week study abroad in Prague, Czech Republic. I did not know a single person going into the trip and was extremely nervous about it; However, I ended up making a ton of friends during my time in Prague and traveled to 3 countries outside of the Czech Republic. </p>
		<p>My friends and I took a trip to Berlin, Germany where we saw a lot of historical monuments and museums for the Holocaust and went to Beer Gardens!</p>

		<p>My friends and I also took a trip to Budapest, Hungary where we went to the famous thermal bath called the Szechenyi Bath.</p>

		<p>Our trip to Austria was likely my favorite experience of my time in Europe! While we spent a majority of our Austria trip in Vienna, we also took a trip to Salzburg where we went on a "Sound of Music" tour through the countryside of Vienna and saw places where the movie was filmed. </p>

		<p> We also made sure to explore cities in the Czech Republic, besides Prague. Český Krumlov is a city that is known for its fairytale like set-up </p>
